We want to explore polarization propagation and attention inequality on a social media environment, using a complex network model. 
The nodes represent the social media users, while the edges represent their online connection, and information flow. 
For polarization progagtion, we may look at the ideological homophily in the network, attention distribution to different users, and users'engagement with polarizing content.
