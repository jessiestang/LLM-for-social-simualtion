Please ensure that your algorithm can generate and collect data on the E-I index for measuring homophily, correlation between partisanship and number of followers, correlation between partisanship and repost activity, and Gini coefficients for the distributions of folloers and reposts.
E-I index is defined as (E - I) / (E + I), where E is the number of edges connecting nodes of different ideologies, and I is the number of edges connecting nodes of the same ideologies.
correlation between partisanship and number of followers is calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient.
correlation between partisanship and repost activity is calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient.
Gini coefficient is calculated using the formula G = 1 - (2 / n) * (Σ (n + 1 - i) * xi) / Σ xi, where n is the number of individuals, xi is the number of followers for individual i, and i is the rank of individual i when individuals are sorted in ascending order by their followers.
Gini coefficient for repost activity is calculated similarly, replacing followers with repost counts.
Print out the statistical results at the end of the simulation.
Please plot a network graph where node colors represent partisanship and node sizes represent number of followers. Ensure the readability of the graph by adjusting node sizes and edge thicknesses appropriately.
